      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a SQL query to find how many employees are in each department. Hmm, I need to look at the database schema provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the departments table has dept_no and dept_name. The dept_emp table links employees to departments with emp_no and dept_no. So to count employees per department, I should join departments with dept_emp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the dept_emp table has emp_no and dept_no. Each row in dept_emp represents an employee's department assignment. So if I group by dept_no from dept_emp, I can count the number of employees. But the question asks for each department, so I should join with departments to get the department name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the departments table has dept_name, so I need to select dept_name from departments and count the employees. But the count should be based on dept_emp. So the correct approach is to join departments and dept_emp on dept_no, then group by dept_no (or dept_name, but better to group by dept_no to avoid duplicates).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the departments table has unique dept_name, so grouping by dept_name should be okay, but maybe better to group by dept_no since it's the primary key. But the user wants the department name, so I should select dept_name and count.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the query would be: SELECT departments.dept_name, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM dept_emp JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no GROUP BY departments.dept_no ORDER BY employee_count DESC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem says to limit to 10 rows. The user didn't specify order, but maybe order by count descending. But the rule says to include ORDER BY as needed. So adding ORDER BY employee_count DESC LIMIT 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says \"how many employees are in each department\", so each department's count. So the correct join is between dept_emp and departments. Because dept_emp has the department numbers linked to employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check the tables again. dept_emp has dept_no which references departments.dept_no. So joining dept_emp and departments on dept_no will give the department name for each employee's department. Then, grouping by dept_no (or dept_name) and counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to get the department name, we need to select departments.dept_name. So the GROUP BY should be on departments.dept_no, but since dept_name is unique, grouping by dept_name would also work. However, in SQL, it's safer to group by the primary key, which is dept_no. But since the question asks for the department name, maybe group by dept_name. Wait, but if two departments have the same name (though the schema says UNIQUE dept_name), so it's safe to group by dept_name. But the schema says UNIQUE(dept_name), so each dept_name is unique. So grouping by dept_name is okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the departments table has dept_name as UNIQUE, so each department name is unique. So grouping by dept_name would be correct. So the query would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(*) AS employee_count\n",
      "FROM dept_emp de\n",
      "JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no\n",
      "GROUP BY d.dept_name\n",
      "ORDER BY employee_count DESC\n",
      "LIMIT 10;\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem says to use only existing columns and tables. Let's check the table names. The departments table is correct. dept_emp is the table linking employees to departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the employees table is mentioned in the schema, but we don't need it here because dept_emp already links emp_no to dept_no. So we don't need to join with employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, because dept_emp has emp_no and dept_no, so counting the rows in dept_emp per department gives the number of employees in each department. So joining with departments to get the name.\n",

But in SQL, if you group by a column that's not part of the GROUP BY clause, it might cause errors. Wait, no, in SQLite, you can group by a column that's not in the SELECT, but it's better to group by the key. Wait, the standard is to group by the columns you're selecting. So if you select dept_name, you should group by dept_name. But since dept_name is unique, grouping by dept_no or dept_name would give the same result.\n",
