      "üí¨ Answer:\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, let's see. The user wants the average salary by department. So I need to calculate the average salary for each department. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that the salaries table has the salary column, and the employees table has emp_no. But to link departments, I need to connect through the dept_emp table. Because dept_emp has emp_no and dept_no, which connects employees to departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the plan is: join the salaries table with dept_emp on emp_no, then join with departments on dept_no. Then group by department and calculate the average salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the departments table has dept_no and dept_name. So the final result should include the department name, maybe. But the question says \"average salary by department\"‚Äîprobably they want the department name and the average salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's schema shows that the departments table has dept_no and dept_name. So I need to include dept_name in the SELECT clause. But the question says to include only existing columns and tables. So I can use dept_name from departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Join salaries with dept_emp on emp_no.\n",
      "2. Then join that result with departments on dept_no.\n",
      "3. Group by dept_no and dept_name to get the average salary per department.\n",
      "4. Use AVG(salary) as the average.\n",
      "5. Maybe order by dept_name or dept_no? The user didn't specify, but the rules say to add ORDER BY if needed. Since the question doesn't specify, maybe it's optional. But to make it more structured, perhaps include ORDER BY dept_name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's rules say to add appropriate clauses. Since the question is about average salary by department, ordering might be helpful. But the user might not require it. However, the rules don't say to include ORDER BY unless needed. Hmm. The original question doesn't specify ordering, so maybe it's not necessary. But maybe the user expects it. Let me check the rules again: \"Add appropriate WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY clauses as needed.\" So if it's needed, add it. Since the question doesn't specify, perhaps it's not required. But maybe the user wants the results ordered. Well, maybe it's safer to include ORDER BY dept_name to have a sorted output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user says to limit to 10 rows unless specified. The question doesn't mention limiting, so maybe not. But the rules say to limit to 10 unless specified otherwise. Since the question doesn't say to limit, we shouldn't add LIMIT. Unless the user wants it. Wait, the original question says \"Limit results to 10 rows unless specified otherwise.\" So unless the question says to limit, we don't. So in this case, no LIMIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the SQL query:\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT departments.dept_name, AVG(salaries.salary) AS avg_salary\n",
      "FROM salaries\n",
      "JOIN dept_emp ON salaries.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no\n",
      "JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no\n",
      "GROUP BY departments.dept_no, departments.dept_name\n",
      "ORDER BY departments.dept_name;\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's rules say to use only existing columns and tables. So the columns dept_name and salary are present. Also, the tables are all there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the salaries table has from_date and to_date. But the question is about average salary, so we need to consider the current salary? Or all salaries? The problem says \"average salary by department\"‚Äîprobably the average of all salaries ever recorded, but maybe we need to consider the current salary. However, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we should take all salaries. But the user's schema includes from_date and to_date. However, the problem doesn't mention filtering by date, so we can ignore those dates. So the query as above would work.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe the salaries are for specific periods. However, the question doesn't specify, so the answer should include all salaries. Therefore, the query is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: the dept_emp table has emp_no and dept_no, but the salaries are linked via emp_no. So joining salaries with dept_emp on emp_no is correct. Then joining with departments on dept_no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. So the final query should be as above. Let me check the syntax for SQLite. SQLite uses JOINs, so that's okay. Also, the GROUP BY needs to include both dept_no and dept_name, since dept_name might not be unique (though in reality, dept_no is the primary key). But in SQLite, if you group by dept_no, and select dept_name, it's allowed if dept_name is functionally dependent on dept_no. However, to be safe, include both in GROUP BY. So the query is correct.\n",
